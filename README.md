Pollen is a highly configurable, responsive toolchain of style-agnostic CSS variables for your next design system. It lets you write faster, more consistent, and more maintainable styles.

Made and maintained with ❤️ by the fine people at [Bokeh](https://bokeh.photo).

### What it looks like

Pollen's design tokens can be used to build any project. They're easy to completely customise and extend and they don't require preprocessors, class naming conventions, or non-standard syntax. Generate an entirely custom design system with a simple config file.
